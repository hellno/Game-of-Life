Usage
=====

Type in values you're asked for and 'magic' starts happening.

Details
-------
Edge length: the created world is always random and square. Choose a value that fits your screen.
Iterations: how much generations will be calculated. Watch until the end!
Seed value: huge crowd (10) or lonely planet (1)? Both will die quickly.
Hz: how fast the output will be displayed (approximately). Works best from 0.5-10. 


That looks like ****
